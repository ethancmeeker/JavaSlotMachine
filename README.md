# Overview

This is just a demonstration on my use of Java using JOptionPanes, classes, functions, variables, arraylists, case statements, loops, and if statements. This code is something fun that I like doing with programming languages making a way to gamble fake moeny on a fake game. I've done others in Python like blackjack and horse racing and adding a slot machine is now a part of my virtual casino.

# Development Environment

I used the java swing library to get JOptionPanes to show up on my program. I used the random library to get random things from a list as well as a library to get arraylists to work in my program. I used Replit.com to edit the code and display the JOptionPanes and the terminal outputs. GitHub was where I posted this to as well. Java was what was used to program the whole thing using a combination of functions, cases, classes, and variables.

# Future Work

{Make a list of things that you need to fix, improve, and add in the future.}
* Would Love to get some images that work with JOptionPanes rather than just the words
* I want to give a spinning animation for the slot machine just like it was a real slot machine 
* I don't want this just to be a slot machine, I would love to get a whole casino running with Java
